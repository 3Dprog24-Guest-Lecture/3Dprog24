# 3Dprog24
This project was developed as part of a 3 session guest lecture series, designed to showcase simple code within game engine development. 
It focuses on three core areas: code structure, scene management, and scene loading with meshes, lights and collision detection. 

## Key Features
- **Code Structure:** Demonstrates object oriented code design for game engines.
- **Scene Management:** Implements scene graph management for handling hierarchical scenes.
- **Model Loading with Collision:** Showcases the loading of 3D models, with lights and collision meshes.

## Showcase
Below are some highlights from the project, illustrating the implemented features and the project's capabilities.
